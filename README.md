# NETWOKRWALKS-B083-WK2-PMI-CYBERSECURITY-LAB-SETUP
This is my Week 2 project for cybersecurity and penetration-testing exercises being done with network walks lab and it focuses on setting up a virtual cybersecurity and penetration-testing laboratory using VirtualBox and Kali Linux.  
Goals
The key goals for this project were to:

Use tools like;
